## stanford dogs dataset 

## Description
This project utilizes the Stanford Dogs dataset, which contains images of 120 breeds of dogs. The dataset is used for training and evaluating image classification models. This project aims to build a model that can accurately identify different dog breeds from images.

## Dataset Information
The Stanford Dogs dataset is a large-scale dataset with over 20,000 images. Each breed has a significant number of images, allowing for robust training of deep learning models.

## setup
This is designed to run in google collab, online jupyter noebook.

### Dataset Access
You can download the Stanford Dogs dataset from  (http://vision.stanford.edu/
aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

## parameters
we write a list of rules for inputs to go in, get manipulated in a way then output come out.

## steps to process the dataset to run the code correctly
Visit the Stanford Dogs Dataset page to download the images.
You can also find the annotations and breed labels in the same location.
After downloading, extract the .tar file .
Create a directory structure to hold the images and annotations.
If youâ€™re using the breed labels, you might need to create a CSV or JSON file that maps image filenames to their respective breed labels.
Ensure your code is set to read the dataset from the correct directory.
Ensure you have all necessary libraries installed (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, etc.).
Run your training or evaluation scripts as intended, making sure they point to the correctly organized dataset.
